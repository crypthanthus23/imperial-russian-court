Imperial Russian Court Relationship System
Modular Implementation Instructions

OVERVIEW:
The original relationship system script was encountering "byte code assembly failed: out of memory" errors
due to LSL's memory limitations. To solve this issue, we've split the system into three separate scripts:

1. Imperial_Court_Relationships_Core.lsl - Handles basic relationship tracking
2. Imperial_Court_Reputation_Module.lsl - Manages reputation and faction influence
3. Imperial_Court_Relationship_System_Connector.lsl - Coordinates communication between modules

INSTALLATION:
To properly install this system in your HUD:

1. Create three separate script objects in your HUD
2. Copy each script into its respective object
3. Place all three script objects in the same HUD
4. Make sure all scripts are properly named to identify their function

HOW IT WORKS:
- The Core script handles basic relationship tracking between avatars
- The Reputation Module manages prestige and faction influence
- The Connector provides a lightweight communication layer between the modules
- All communication happens via specific channels, authenticated with a shared key

MEMORY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES USED:
1. Divided functionality into separate scripts to reduce memory per script
2. Simplified data structures and eliminated duplicate information storage
3. Reduced maximum tracking limits to conserve memory
4. Simplified sorting and processing functions
5. Consolidated redundant functions
6. Streamlined menu options and dialog flows

EXTENDING THE SYSTEM:
You can further extend this system by creating additional modules for:
- Detailed interaction history
- Specific faction relationships
- Court event tracking
- Specialized menus for different aristocratic ranks

Each module should communicate through the same channels and use the same authentication mechanism.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you encounter issues:
- Check that all three scripts are present in the HUD
- Verify all scripts use the same authentication key
- Restart the HUD by detaching and reattaching
- If a specific script still has memory issues, it may need further optimization
