# Tsarevich Alexei HUD - Installation Guide

## Overview
The Imperial Tsarevich HUD is a specialized system designed for roleplaying Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, the hemophiliac heir to the Russian throne. This HUD simulates his unique medical condition and royal status in the Imperial Russian Court.

## Required Components

To properly set up the complete Tsarevich HUD system, you'll need three main components:

1. **Imperial_Tsarevich_HUD.lsl** - The main script that handles Tsarevich-specific functionality
2. **Imperial_System_Connector.lsl** - The central hub that connects various modules
3. **Imperial_Court_Meter_Updated.lsl** - The floating text display for stats

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Create the HUD Object
1. In Second Life, create a new object (prim) with an appropriate appearance
2. Name it "Imperial Tsarevich HUD"
3. In the Edit menu, check "Attachment" and set it to be worn as a HUD
4. Consider adding multiple prims to make a visually appealing HUD design

### Step 2: Add the Scripts
1. Place **Imperial_Tsarevich_HUD.lsl** into the HUD's root prim inventory
2. Place **Imperial_System_Connector.lsl** into the same prim or a linked prim
3. Check that the UUID in the Tsarevich HUD script matches your player's UUID:
   ```
   key TSAREVICH_UUID = "707c2fdf-6f8a-43c9-a5fb-3debc0941064";
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Meter Object
1. Create a separate object that will display floating text above the avatar
2. Name it "Imperial Tsarevich Meter"
3. In the Edit menu, check "Attachment" and set it to attach above the head
4. Place the **Imperial_Court_Meter_Updated.lsl** script into this object

### Step 4: Understanding the Communication System
The components communicate through several channels:
- The Tsarevich HUD uses **METER_CHANNEL** (-8675309) to send updates to its internal text display
- The System Connector uses **HUD_LINK_MESSAGE_CHANNEL** (-55555) to route messages between modules
- The Meter uses **STATS_CHANNEL** (-987654321) to receive and display stats

## Usage Instructions for Players

### Basic Commands
- **/ooc** - Toggle Out Of Character mode
- **/rest** - Toggle resting state (accelerates health recovery)
- **/activity [type]** - Record an activity (can trigger hemophilia)
- **/caregiver [name]** - Register a current caregiver
- **/stats** - View current health and condition stats

### Hemophilia Management
The hemophilia system automatically:
- Maintains a baseline risk level (5-15%)
- Increases risk with dangerous activities
- May trigger bleeding episodes that require rest and care
- Recovers faster when a caregiver is present

### Safe vs. Dangerous Activities
Players should be aware of:

**Safe Activities** (reduce hemophilia risk):
- Reading
- Drawing
- Gentle play
- Sailing toy boats
- Stamp collecting

**Dangerous Activities** (increase hemophilia risk):
- Running
- Jumping
- Climbing
- Fighting
- Playing rough

## Troubleshooting

### HUD Not Connecting to Meter
1. Check that both objects are worn correctly
2. Ensure all communication channels match in both scripts
3. Try resetting both scripts (detach and reattach)

### Hemophilia System Issues
1. Verify the Tsarevich UUID is correctly set
2. Use the /stats command to check current health and risk levels
3. Try toggling rest mode and activity tracking

### Memory Management
The System Connector has a built-in memory management system that:
- Monitors script memory usage
- Prunes event history when memory gets low
- Issues warnings when memory usage is high

## Additional Notes
- The Tsarevich must be treated with appropriate deference by other players
- Only physicians and immediate family should be allowed to treat bleeding episodes
- The HUD is designed to create a historically accurate portrayal of hemophilia
- Touch the System Connector to view current stats and system status
