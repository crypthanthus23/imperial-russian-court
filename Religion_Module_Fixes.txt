# Religion Module Fixes

## Issue Fixed
1. Added missing `touch_start()` event handler to the Religion Module to allow players to interact with it by touching it

## Religion System Functionality
1. Players can now access religion features by:
   - Touching the Religion Module directly 
   - Selecting "Religion" from the main HUD menu
2. Religion features include:
   - Basic prayer (small faith increase)
   - Confession (moderate faith increase, reputation restoration)
   - Communion (larger faith increase, health benefit)
   - Church donations (faith increase based on amount donated)
   - Cathedral access for venerating relics and icons
   - Special features for clergy characters

## Technical Implementation
1. Variables synchronized between Core HUD and Religion Module:
   - faith: Religious devotion (0-100)
   - isDead: Death status for resurrection miracles
   - ownedRelics: Sacred items in player's possession
   - venerated: List of relics venerated today (daily cooldown)
2. Communication Flow:
   - Core HUD to Religion Module: Data sent via REQUEST_RELIGION_DATA
   - Religion Module to Core HUD: Faith updates via UPDATE_FAITH
   - Donation handling through CHECK_RUBLES and DONATION_RESULT messages
3. All faith improvements update both modules to keep data consistent

## Spiritual System Benefits
1. Regular religious participation increases faith stat
2. Faith provides both tangible benefits and roleplaying opportunities:
   - Health restoration through communion and miracles
   - Reputation benefits through confession and donations
   - Resurrection possibility through sacred relics
   - Immersive historical Russian Orthodox Church roleplay

## Religious Ranks
For Clergy characters, the following ranks are supported:
1. Patriarch (highest)
2. Metropolitan
3. Archbishop
4. Bishop
5. Priest (lowest)
