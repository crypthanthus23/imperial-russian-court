# Imperial Court Meter System Fixes

## Recent Fixes

1. **Removed "incomplete stats data" error**
   - The meter no longer requires exactly 10 stats fields
   - This makes the meter more robust to handle partial data
   - The HUD can now send any subset of stats and the meter will display what it can

2. **Fixed reserved keyword issue**
   - Changed `key` variable to `keyName` to prevent conflicts with LSL's reserved keyword
   - This resolves syntax errors in the meter script

3. **Added channel documentation**
   - Clarified that the STATS_CHANNEL (-987654321) must match METER_STATS_CHANNEL in Core HUD
   - Ensures proper communication between components

4. **Added debugging capabilities**
   - Commented debug statements can be enabled to help troubleshoot communication issues
   - Shows raw data received from HUD and number of parsed data parts

## OOC Mode Display

When in OOC mode, the meter will:
1. Only display "OOC" in blue text
2. Hide all character stats
3. Return to normal display when OOC mode is toggled off

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to have meter communication issues:
1. Verify that the Core HUD and meter are using the same channel number
2. Uncomment the debug lines in the meter script to see exactly what data is being received
3. Check that the data format follows the expected pattern: `NAME:value|CLASS:value|RANK:value|...`
4. Ensure the meter is physically attached to the same avatar as the HUD

## Connection Process

The meter and HUD connect using this sequence:
1. HUD sends "CONNECT_METER:[ownerID]" on the stats channel
2. Meter verifies owner and responds with "HUD_CONNECTED"
3. HUD begins sending stats updates in the format: `NAME:value|CLASS:value|RANK:value|...`
