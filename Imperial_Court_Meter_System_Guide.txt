# Imperial Court Meter System Guide

## Introduction

This document explains how the Imperial Court Meter System works across different character types. The meter system is designed to display relevant character statistics as floating text above a player's avatar. Different character types have specialized meters to reflect their unique status and abilities.

## Standard Meter System

The standard meter system (Imperial_Court_Meter_Fixed.lsl) listens on the `-987654321` channel and expects to receive stats in the following format:

```
STATS:Name:Title:Health:Faith:Wealth:Influence:Status:Rubles
```

This works with the standard HUD system (Imperial_Russian_Court_Core_HUD.lsl) which sends updates in this format.

## Specialized Character Meters

### Tsarevich Meter System

The Tsarevich has a specialized meter (Imperial_Tsarevich_Meter.lsl) that listens on two channels:
- Standard stats channel (`-987654321`)
- Tsarevich-specific channel (`-8675309`)

The Tsarevich HUD sends messages in two different formats:
1. Using `llMessageLinked()` for internal HUD-to-meter communication
2. Using `llRegionSay()` to broadcast to attached meters
3. Also sending in standard format for compatibility with other systems

### Other Royal HUDs

Other royal HUDs (Tsar, Tsarina, Grand Duchesses) have similar but specialized meters that display information relevant to their titles and positions.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your meter is not displaying stats correctly, check these common issues:

1. **Communication Channels**: Make sure your HUD and meter are using the same communication channels.
2. **Message Format**: Verify that the HUD is sending data in the format the meter expects.
3. **Attachments**: Ensure both the HUD and meter are properly attached to your avatar.
4. **Script Reset**: Try resetting both the HUD and meter scripts.
5. **OOC Mode**: Check if you're in OOC mode, which disables stat display.

## For Specialized Characters (Tsar, Tsarevich, etc.)

If you are playing as a specialized character (Tsar, Tsarevich, Grand Duchess, etc.), make sure you:

1. Are using the correct HUD for your character
2. Have the matching meter script for your character type
3. Are authorized to use that character (correct UUID)

## UUID Verification

Some special character HUDs are restricted to specific UUIDs:
- Tsar Nikolai II: `49238f92-08a4-4f72-bca4-e66a15c75e02`
- Tsarevich Alexei: `707c2fdf-6f8a-43c9-a5fb-3debc0941064`

If your UUID doesn't match, the HUD will show a warning and may not function correctly.

## Advanced Customization

For modders and script developers:
- The meter system is modular and can be extended with new stats
- New character types can be added by creating specialized meter scripts
- Communication format can be modified but must be consistent between HUD and meter
