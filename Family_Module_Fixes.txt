# Imperial Court Family Module Fixes

## Issues Fixed
1. Added missing `touch_start()` event handler to the Family Module to allow players to interact with it by touching it
2. Enhanced Core HUD data exchange with proper family system variables:
   - dynastyName
   - familyHeadID
   - familyHeadName
   - familyMembers (list)
   - familyNames (list)
   - familyRelations (list)
   - familyRank
   - foundedFamily (boolean)
   - isHeir (boolean)
   - joinedDate

## Family System Functionality
1. Players can now access family features by:
   - Touching the Family Module directly
   - Selecting "Family" from the main HUD menu
2. Family features include:
   - Dynasty founding
   - Heir appointment
   - Family member management 
   - Dynasty status display
   - Family history tracking

## Technical Implementation
1. Added proper touch interaction through the touch_start() event handler
2. Enhanced the REQUEST_FAMILY_DATA handler in Core HUD:
   - Now sends complete family data in proper format
   - Automatically creates family dynasty for Tsar and high nobles
   - Includes properly formatted member list
3. Added FAMILY_UPDATE handler to Core HUD:
   - Processes family updates from the Family Module
   - Updates all family variables
   - Provides bonuses for family heads and heirs
   - Updates HUD display and meter with new family status
4. Enhanced message formatting in Family Module:
   - Properly formats family member lists for data transfer
   - Ensures consistent data format between modules

## Dynasty Benefits
1. Family heads receive influence and reputation bonuses
2. Designated heirs receive special privileges and status indicators
3. Dynasty members can access exclusive court functions
4. Family connections influence social interactions and standings

## Notes
- All data is transferred between modules using pipe-delimited strings
- Family member lists use a specialized format: "ID:Name:Relation;ID:Name:Relation"
- Both Core HUD and Family Module can now process this data correctly
- Dynasty status is immediately visible on the HUD text

These changes integrate the Family Module fully with the Core HUD and complete the
family lineage system for the Imperial Russian Court roleplay experience.
