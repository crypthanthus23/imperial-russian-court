# Banking Module Fixes

## Issues Fixed
1. Added missing `touch_start()` event handler to the Banking Module to allow players to interact with it by touching it
2. Added bankAccount variable to Core HUD to track bank balance (previously it was hardcoded as "0")
3. Added loans list variable to Core HUD to track player loans
4. Updated REQUEST_BANK_DATA handler in Core HUD to use the bankAccount variable instead of hardcoded "0"
5. Enhanced data exchange between modules:
   - Added UPDATE_BANK_ACCOUNT message from Banking Module to Core HUD
   - Added UPDATE_LOANS message from Banking Module to Core HUD
   - Implemented proper handlers for these messages in Core HUD
6. Made sure bank account updates happen with all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, and interest)

## Banking System Functionality
1. Players can now access the bank by:
   - Touching the Banking Module directly
   - Selecting "Bank" from the main HUD menu
2. Banking features include:
   - Deposits and withdrawals of rubles
   - Daily interest on savings (3% per annum)
   - View loans and loan management
   - Special features for banker characters

## Technical Implementation
1. Synchronized variables between Core HUD and Banking Module:
   - rubles: Currency on hand
   - bankAccount: Money stored in the bank
   - loans: List of active loans in string format
   - medicalDebt: Medical expenses owed
2. Communication Flow:
   - Core HUD to Banking Module: Data sent via REQUEST_BANK_DATA
   - Banking Module to Core HUD: Updates sent via UPDATE_BANK_ACCOUNT and UPDATE_LOANS
3. All financial transactions update both modules to keep data consistent

## Further Improvements
1. Could add loan request/approval workflow
2. Could implement bank database for multi-player banking
3. Could add investment options with varying returns
