Imperial Tsarina HUD and Meter Installation Guide
==================================================

This guide explains how to properly set up and use the Imperial Tsarina HUD and Meter system for roleplaying Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in the Imperial Russian Court system.

1. COMPONENTS
-------------
The system consists of two essential components:

a) Imperial_Tsarina_HUD.lsl
   - The main HUD script that must be installed in a HUD attachment worn by the player
   - Contains all Tsarina-specific functionality and roles
   - Handles dialog menus, command processing, and meter communication

b) Imperial_Tsarina_Meter.lsl
   - The specialized meter script that displays the Tsarina's status as floating text
   - Must be installed in a separate attachment worn above the avatar
   - Features Tsarina-specific styling and information displays

2. INSTALLATION
--------------
To install the system properly:

a) Create a HUD object (recommended: a crown or imperial emblem)
   - Add the Imperial_Tsarina_HUD.lsl script to this object
   - Attach to the HUD position (recommended: top-right)
   - This object should not be visible to others

b) Create a meter object (recommended: a small transparent prim)
   - Add the Imperial_Tsarina_Meter.lsl script to this object
   - Attach above the avatar's head
   - This object will display floating text visible to all

3. USAGE
-------
Once installed, the Tsarina can use the following features:

a) Touch the HUD to access the main menu with options:
   - Family: Monitor the Imperial children and provide guidance
   - Charity: Manage charitable foundations and make donations
   - Court: Handle court appointments and events
   - Religious: Engage in spiritual activities and consult with Rasputin
   - Imperial Powers: Exercise Tsarina prerogatives
   - OOC Mode: Toggle between in-character and out-of-character modes

b) Special Chat Commands:
   - /meter: Manually reconnect to the floating text meter if it becomes disconnected
   
c) Unique Tsarina Abilities:
   - Faith Healing for Alexei: Activate a prayer vigil to help the Tsarevich's health
   - Imperial Treasury Access: Make large charitable donations (up to 10,000 rubles)
   - Court Appointments: Appoint or dismiss ladies-in-waiting
   - Imperial Mother: Provide maternal guidance to the Imperial children

4. TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------
If the meter is not displaying properly:

a) Verify both scripts are running in their respective objects
b) Use the "/meter" chat command to force reconnection
c) If problems persist, reset both scripts by removing and re-adding them

5. TECHNICAL DETAILS
------------------
The HUD and meter communicate on channel -987654321 using a standardized protocol:

a) Connection Initialization:
   - HUD sends "CONNECT_METER:[UUID]" 
   - Meter confirms with "HUD_CONNECTED"

b) Data Transmission:
   - HUD sends "STATS_DATA:" followed by formatted stats
   - Format: [value1]||[value2]||[value3]...

c) Periodic Updates:
   - Meter requests "REQUEST_STATS_UPDATE" every 30 seconds
   - HUD maintains backup text display in case of meter failure

Remember that the Tsarina role carries significant responsibility within the Imperial Court. Your actions affect the entire royal family, particularly the health of Tsarevich Alexei through faith healing interventions.

For any technical issues with the script system, please contact the Imperial Russian Court system administrators.
